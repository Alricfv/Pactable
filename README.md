# Pactable 
Pactable is a simple, minimalistic platform that was designed to make simple, effective and easily accessible agreements that you can make when it comes to stuff like "Joined Tenancies (Student Houses)" or Freelance work.
Anyone can draft clear agreements, invite participants and even sign it online as well as track the signature statuses from other users using my tool. Pretty neat huh?
